# Python Challenge

#### -- Project Status: Completed

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is demonstrate basic data analysis using Python.

### Technologies
* Python

## Project Description
Data analysis was performed on two different .csv files.  The different python scripts can be found in the [PyBank Directory](https://github.com/kreitlerj/python-challenge/tree/master/PyBank) and the [PyPoll Directory](https://github.com/kreitlerj/python-challenge/tree/master/PyPoll).  For the analysis, the .csv file is loaded into the script, the main.py script performs an analysis and prints a report to the console, and finally writes the report to a .txt file.

## Needs of this project
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- writeup/reporting

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept in each directory [PyBank Directory](https://github.com/kreitlerj/python-challenge/tree/master/PyBank) and [PyPoll Directory](https://github.com/kreitlerj/python-challenge/tree/master/PyPoll)
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept in each directory: [PyBank Directory](https://github.com/kreitlerj/python-challenge/tree/master/PyBank) and [PyPoll Directory](https://github.com/kreitlerj/python-challenge/tree/master/PyPoll)
4. To run the scripts, open the directory path in the console and type python main.py
